### Czech National Phytosociological Database

The Czech National Phytosociological Database (CNPD) is collecting digital vegetation-plot records (phytosociological relevés) from the territory of the Czech Republic in a single database, which facilitate easy access to relevant data for vegetation survey, ecological analyses and applications in nature conservation. These activities are a part of broader European projects coordinated by the Working Group for European Vegetation Survey of the ([International Association for Vegetation Science](http://iavs.org/)). CNPD closely cooperates with the European Vegetation Archive ([EVA](http://euroveg.org/eva-database)) and the Global Vegetation Database ([sPlot](https://www.idiv.de/en/splot.html)). The database was established with the help of the Darwin Initiative project coordinated by Professor John Rodwell at Lancaster University, UK (1995–1998). Since 1999 the database project has been funded from various projects of Masaryk University, most of them provided by the Czech Science Foundation.

The Czech National Phytosociological Database is coordinated at the Department of Botany and Zoology, Masaryk University, Brno. The coordinators of the database are Milan Chytrý (📧 [chytry\@sci.muni.cz](mailto:chytry@sci.muni.cz)) and Ilona Knollová (📧 [ikuzel\@sci.muni.cz](mailto:ikuzel@sci.muni.cz)), and there are local coordinators in other academic institutions in the Czech Republic. An integral part of the database project is the development of methods for data analysis. Major procedures developed so far are available in the [JUICE](http://www.sci.muni.cz/botany/juice.htm)software developed by Lubomír Tichý.

The basic statistics about the Czech National Phytosociological Database were published by [Chytrý & Rafajová (2003)](http://www.sci.muni.cz/botany/chytry/Pre2003.pdf), with an update in a short report by [Chytrý & Michalcová (2012)](http://www.biodiversity-plants.de/biodivers_ecol/publishing/b-e.00136.pdf). The database is registered in the [Global Index of Vegetation-plot Databases](http://www.givd.info/ID/EU-CZ-001) (GIVD, [Dengler et al. 2011](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1654-1103.2011.01265.x/abstract)) with the code EU-CZ-001.

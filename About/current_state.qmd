In July 2020 the central database contained more than 113 800 relevés from the territory of the Czech Republic. Most relevés belong to phytosociological classes of broad-leaved forests (*Querco-Fagetea*), meadows and mesic pastures (*Molinio-Arrhenatheretea*), marshes (*Phragmito-Magno-Caricetea*), dry grasslands (*Festuco-Brometea*) and disturbed vegetation of wet to mesic habitats (*Galio-Urticetea*). Phytosociological bibliography of the Czech Republic, with an indication which data sources have been digitized and included in the database, is available [here](http://www.sci.muni.cz/botany/tvref/).

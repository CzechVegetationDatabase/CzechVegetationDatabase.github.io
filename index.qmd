The Czech Vegetation Database (formerly the Czech National Phytosociological Database) is a digital archive of vegetation-plot records from the territory of the Czech Republic. It includes phytosociological relevés, i.e., records of plant species composition and cover-abundances in delimited plots within relatively homogeneous vegetation patches, as well as similar data from vegetation surveys, monitoring programs, and ecological studies.

The database is registered in the Global Index of Vegetation-Plot Databases ([GIVD](#0), [Dengler et al. 2011](#0)) with the code [EU-CZ-001](#0). It is a member of the European Vegetation Archive ([EVA](#0), [Chytrý et al. 2016](#0)) and the Global Vegetation Database ([sPlot](#0), [Bruelheide et al. 2019](#0)).

It is coordinated at the [Department of Botany and Zoology](https://botzool.sci.muni.cz), Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic. The current database manager is Ilona Knollová ([ikuzel\@sci.muni.cz](mailto:ikuzel@sci.muni.cz)).

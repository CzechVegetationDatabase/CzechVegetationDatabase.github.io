## 1. Introduction

The Czech Vegetation Database (formerly the *Czech National Phytosociological Database*) is an open digital archive of vegetation-plot records from the territory of the Czech Republic. It includes phytosociological relevés, i.e., records of plant species composition and cover-abundances in delimited plots within relatively homogeneous vegetation patches, as well as similar vegetation-plot data from vegetation surveys, monitoring programs, and ecological studies.

The database is registered in the *Global Index of Vegetation-Plot Databases* ([GIVD](https://www.givd.info/), [Dengler et al. 2011](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-1103.2011.01265.x)) with the code [EU-CZ-001](http://www.givd.info/ID/EU-CZ-001). It is a member of the *European Vegetation Archive* ([EVA](https://euroveg.org/eva-database/), [Chytrý et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1111/avsc.12191)), its subset of resurveyed vegetation plots ([ReSurveyEurope](https://euroveg.org/resurvey/), [Knollová et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.13235)), and *sPlot – the Global Vegetation Database* ([sPlot](https://www.idiv.de/en/splot.html), [Bruelheide et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12710)).

It is coordinated at the [Vegetation Science Group](https://botzool.cz/vegsci/), [Department of Botany and Zoology](https://botzool.sci.muni.cz/en), Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic. The current database administrator is Ilona Knollová ([ikuzel\@sci.muni.cz](mailto:ikuzel@sci.muni.cz)).

In November 2025, the database contained 116,314 vegetation plots from the Czech Republic, sampled between 1922 and 2025. These plots represent all vegetation types found in the country, with grassland and forest plots being the most numerous, followed by plots from wetlands, ruderal, and weed vegetation.

## 2. Online Viewer

This interactive viewer of the Czech Vegetation Database provides maps and summary characteristics of vegetation plots for the whole database and its subsets defined by plot size and location uncertainty, years of sampling, altitude, covers of vegetation layers, and occurrence of specific species or species groups.
